  <h3>How it works:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Click the button above to be redirected to Twitter.</li>
    <li>Authorize wynno to read from your Home timeline, by signing into Twitter.</li>
    <li>wynno never sees your password, and can't post anything to Twitter on your behalf.</li>
    <li>That's it! You will be redirected back to wynno, where you can enjoy your Twitter timeline winnowed down to the good stuff.</li>
  </ol>
