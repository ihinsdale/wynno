Hello, world!

wynno is a tool for seeing the tweets in your Twitter timeline that interest you, and skipping the rest.

The more people you follow on Twitter, the more you probably find yourself sifting through tweets that don't interest you to find the ones that do. That's the problem that wynno wants to solve.

It's not a problem that can be solved simply by unfollowing people. Unfollowing someone is too crude a solution if you like some of a person's tweets, and don't want to miss out on those.

wynno helps you winnow your Twitter timeline down to the stuff you like. It does this in two ways: filters, and automatic wynnoing.

Filters are simply rules you make about the kinds of tweets you always want to 'hear' or 'mute'. Maybe you always want to see tweets that contain...

At any 

 Muted tweets are takOr maybe you want to mute that annoying former coworker entirely (unfollowing them might sow the seed of awkwardness)

wynno helps you mute the noise, so to speak, among all the. Turn the cacophony of chirping birds into a symphony.

Maybe you always want to see tweets that contain 'BREAKING:' news--or maybe you never do. Maybe you always want to see tweets by that well-read friend of yours who's always tweeting quotations. Maybe you never want to see tweets that mention Congress. Maybe you always want to see tweets that contain a particular hashtag. Maybe you don't ever want to see tweets by that annoying former coworker which contain pictures.

wynno is a tool for getting more out of Twitter. It does that by helping you remove the stuff you don't care about from your Timeline. Less noise means more time for exploring the tweets that interest you.

 helps you get more out of Twitter by reducing the number of tweets in your timeline which you don't care about.
