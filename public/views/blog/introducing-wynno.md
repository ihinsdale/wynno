Hello, world!

wynno is a tool for seeing the tweets in your Twitter timeline that interest you and skipping the rest.

The more people you follow on Twitter, the more you probably find yourself sifting through tweets that don't interest you to find the ones that do. That's the problem that wynno wants to solve.

It's not a problem that can be solved by unfollowing people. Unfollowing someone is too crude a solution if you like some of a person's tweets, and don't want to miss out on those.

wynno enables a finer approach: you can apply specific filters to your Twitter timeline. Filters are simply rules you make about the kinds of tweets you want to 'hear' or 'mute'. Maybe you always want to hear tweets that contain a particular hashtag. Maybe you always want to keep up with breaking news, and so you always want to hear tweets that contain a keyword like 'BREAKING'. Or maybe you want to mute those tweets. Maybe you never want to see Foursquare updates or links to Facebook from that former coworker of yours, whom you don't really know anyway but nevertheless don't want to unfollow because that would sow seeds of awkwardness. Maybe you always want to hear tweets by that well-read friend of yours whenever she tweets quotations. But maybe you've seen enough baby pictures from her by now.

You can make filters for all of these. All tweets caught by a 'hear' filter or which aren't caught by any filter are put in a timeline called Good Stuff. This is the timeline which you see first whenever you load wynno. All tweets caught by a 'mute' filter get moved to another timeline called The Rest. You can look at The Rest as much as you want to, or not look at it at all. That's the simple innovation of wynno: splitting your Twitter timeline in two, according to the rules you make.

There is more complexity to wynno which you can take advantage of if you want to, though. wynno can suggest filters for you to adopt. wynno can even create a customized filter just for you which will mute tweets that it thinks you won't like.

wynno takes your Twitter timeline and helps you winnow out the tweets you don't like, so that only the good stuff is left. It does this in two ways: filters, and automatic wynnoing.

Filters are simply rules you make about the kinds of tweets you always want to 'hear' or 'mute' (a tweet is, strictly speaking, a bird noise, so we figured the language of listening was appropriate).

Maybe you always want to see tweets that contain 'BREAKING:' news--or maybe you never do. Maybe you always want to see tweets by that well-read friend of yours who's always tweeting quotations.
