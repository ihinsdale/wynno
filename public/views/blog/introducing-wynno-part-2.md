Filters are simple, effective, and the essence of wynno. But there is more complexity to wynno that you can take advantage of if you want to:

1. wynno can **suggest filters** for you to adopt.
2. wynno can even create a customized filter just for you which will predict which tweets you won't like and mute them. We call this **automatic wynnoing**.

wynno can do these things once you give it a bit of training, to recognize the tweets you like and dislike. wynno places vote buttons next to tweets that aren't handled by any of your filters.

When you vote on tweets, you're telling wynno, "I like tweets like this and want to see this kind of tweet in the future," or the opposite. It's wynno's job to figure out what you mean exactly by 'like this' and 'this kind of tweet'. Because wynno needs a fair amount of data to figure that out, filter suggestions are currently offered after every 100 votes.

Automatic wynnoing requires yet more data to work well; 200 votes are necessary before it can be activated. We'll discuss automatic wynnoing in more depth in another post. For now, we'll just say that the algorithm behind automatic wynnoing is conservative: we recognize that for most users, it's more important not to mute any tweets that you do like than to find and mute all the tweets that you don't like.

One last thing, about **privacy**: your activity on wynno is between you and wynno. The filters you create, your votes on tweets--none of these are visible to other users. wynno's goal is to improve the experience of consuming your Twitter timeline, by reducing the amount of time spent reading tweets that aren't valuable to you. It helps you turn the cacophony of chirping birds into something more like a symphony. It is not a social network and does not create another public, online presence for you to manage. If you have thoughts on that, or any other aspect of wynno, we'd love to hear from you
