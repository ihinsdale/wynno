  # We need to do this because restarting SSH implements our change of the SSH port
  # Note also that this step needs to be the last handler, so that it is the very last
  # step in the common role, i.e. so we don't need to SSH back into the server as root
  # which we can't do because that has been disabled after restarting SSH
  set_fact: ansible_ssh_port={{ new_ssh_port }}
