To setup/launch/create the app truly from scratch:

-1.  Any changes to files in lib/config/keys/prod require 'grunt build' to be run on the
    developer's local machine, so that the changes are propagated to
    /dist/lib/config/keys/prod. It's these keys in the /dist folder which are what
    get dynamically populated with IP addresses of the relevant app nodes
    and then deployed to the relevant nodes.
0.  new_droplets_config.json should be specified as desired and COMMITed if any
    changes were made. We want to keep track of the app 'inventory' using version
    control.
1.  Setup AWS EC2 instance, to be used as a gateway to the rest of the app. Instance
    should use a permanent IP address (i.e. AWS' so-called Elastic IP - currently
    it's 54.187.29.221) because the app's nodes are all firewalled so that they can
    only be accessed by SSH from that IP address. The instance's security group
    should, at first, only allow port 22 SSH from 'my IP', i.e. whatever the
    developer's IP is.
2.  With the gateway instance set up, scp from the developer's local machine
    setup_wynno_gateway_pt_1.sh and setup_wynno_gateway_pt_2.sh onto the gateway
    instance.
3.  SSH into the gateway instance, having setup the necessary host info in
    developer's local .ssh/config file.
4.  Run setup_wynno_gateway_pt_1.sh. Exit the SSH connection when script finishes.
5.  Revise developer's local .ssh/config file so that the Port for the wynno-gateway
    (or whatever the developer named Host as in the config file) host is now 202
    (setup_wynno_gateway_pt_1.sh changes the SSH port from 22 to 202).
6.  Modify the AWS security group applied to the gateway instance so that instance
    can only be accessed by TCP on port 202 from 'my IP'.
7.  SSH back into the gateway instance.
8.  Run setup_wynno_gateway_pt_2.sh. Once it finishes, exit the SSH connection.
9.  scp dist/lib/config/keys/prod/node.json and dist/lib/config/keys/prod/python.json
    to corresponding location on the gateway instance.
10. scp sysadmin/prod/roles/nginx/files/www_wynno_com.pem and
    sysadmin/prod/roles/nginx/files/www_wynno_com.key to corresponding locations
    on the gateway instance.
11. SSH into gateway instance and run setup_from_t0.sh.
