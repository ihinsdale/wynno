description "Upstart script to run the wynno Node.js servers"

# Originally I had tried to use Forever with this Upstart script. However
# I simply could not get the script to run successfully. So I abandoned
# the use of Forever and instead just use the respawn option to relaunch
# node if it fails (Cf. http://stackoverflow.com/a/22945382)
