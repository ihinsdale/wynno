1. Create EC2 instance with port 22, port 202, port 80, port 443 open to my IP. Associate the wynno-dev Elastic
   IP (snap-c5f81436) with this instance, and also attach a volume created from the db snapshot snap-c5f81436.
2. Run the Ansible site.yml playbook with the development inventory file:
   ansible-playbook -i development site.yml
3. SSH into the instance on Port 202
4. Open up a screen session
5. Launch in separate windows:
   - sudo mongod --auth --dbpath ~/db/data
   - python server.py
   - sudo service redis-server start
   - nodemon wynno/dist/server.js
   - sudo service nginx restart
