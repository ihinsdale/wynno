Workflow for deploying updates to production code:

1. Commit to wynno repository and push to GitHub.
2. [insert testing steps here]
3. When ready to actually deploy the code, run push_to_prod_repo.sh.
4. SSH into wynno-gateway.
5. Pull from wynno-prod-sysadmin repo.
6. Use Ansible to propagate/deploy the new code to relevant app nodes.
