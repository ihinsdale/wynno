When a blog post is ready to be published, follow this procedure:

1. Ensure that you are on the master branch and that THE MASTER BRANCH IS CLEAN, i.e. there are no outstanding changes to be committed.
2. Copy the blog post's Markdown file from /blog_drafts to to /public/views/blog, as well as any necessary images copied to /public/views/images/blog.
3. /public/views/blog/index.json should be updated: an object should be appended to the posts array with the relevant details, and the lookup object should also have a key-value pair added to it with the post's slug and id.
4. `grunt build` should be run, to copy over the new post and info into the dist folder.
5. The repo should be committed at this point - ENSURING ONCE AGAIN that you are on the master branch and that NO OTHER CHANGES besides the new blog post are being committed.
6. sysadmin/prod/manual/push_to_prod_repo.sh should then be run.
7. SSH into the wynno gateway.
8. On wynno-gateway, from within /sysadmin/prod, run `ansible-playbook -i production blog_post_publish.yml --ask-vault-pass -vvvv`
