Mute a user entirely:

Hear tweets that contain a link to a certain domain

Mute tweets from particular users that contain a picture:

Hear tweets that contain a quotation:

Mute a user's retweets:

Note that it's currently not possible to hear or mute *all retweets from all users*, but that capability is in the pipeline.

Active filters are applied to tweets in the order they are listed, that is, from the top down. That means if a tweet matches the criteria of both a hear filter and a mute filter, the filter that is listed first is the one that gets applied. Since active filters are currently listed in the order in which they were created, older filters take priority over newly created filters. This chronological priority is only temporary, though; we are hard at work on a drag-and-drop feature that will allow you to easily reorder your filters however you want.
