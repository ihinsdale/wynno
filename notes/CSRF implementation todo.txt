-need to convert GET requests for /old, /new, and /middle to POST requests b/c those requests can change state
-also convert routes for login and logout? Those do change state, albeit just in a limited way
  - logout yes, login...no...it seems, for one thing the passport-twitter auth examples have both the auth routes as GETs

if i want user to be able to send feedback without having logged in, I need to use the csrf-cookie-setting middleware on EVERY request so that the user is guaranteed to have gotten the csrf cookie by the time they want to do the POST request to /feedback --> do this

DO I NEED TO SANITIZE THE FEEDBACK FORM INPUT IN ANY WAY?
