pre-existing setting of errors on scope (i.e. before I introduced the 500 handler in interceptor.js):
- NavCtrl - okay because these only pertain to displaying an alert inside the filter builder modal
- SettingsCtrl - nothing important to change
- MainCtrl - kept error tracking functionality in place on the scope, but removed the corresponding html in main.thml
