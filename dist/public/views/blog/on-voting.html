<p>Voting on tweets is by no means required in order to use wynno. If you know just what filters you want and don't need any help with that from wynno, that's great! If you aren't sure about what filters you should create, though, you should give voting a try.</p>

<p>Voting will help you realize what filters you should create, and it will also help wynno give you some suggestions.</p>

<p>As you vote on tweets, you'll start to get a sense of the kinds of tweets you like and dislike. You'll start to think of rules you could turn into filters: maybe you tend not to like somebody's retweets, or you always like tweets that link to some blog, or you don't like tweets that contain some phrase. And so on.</p>

<p>Voting is also easy! Sure, it involves a click more you're used to. But the snap judgments of whether you like a tweet or not&mdash;you already make these. It's why you laugh at a tweet, retweet it, favorite it, or follow a link&mdash;or in the other direction, why you make that 'Tsshh' sound in annoyance and keep scanning your timeline for something you actually care about.</p>

<p>The more you vote, the better a sense wynno gets of what you like and don't like. This enables wynno to suggest filters for you to adopt, and to improve your automatic wynnoing filter (should you wish to activate it). We hope that voting is a satisfying experience, for that reason; ultimately you're making it more likely that you'll see only the tweets you're interested in. One user has even described voting as cathartic!</p>

<p>Remember that your votes are private. No one's feelings will be hurt when you vote that you dislike a tweet.</p>

<p>Here are some guidelines for getting the most out of voting:
  <ol>
    <li>Think of your votes as telling wynno:
      <ul>
        <li><span class="aye icomoon-checkmark-circle">kk</span> &ndash; "I like tweets like this and want to see this kind of tweet in the future."</li>
        <li><span class="nay icomoon-cancel-circle"></span> &ndash; "I don't care about tweets like this and would be happy not to see them in the future."</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>You don't need to vote on every tweet. In fact, you shouldn't vote on every tweet. Vote only when you have a quick, clear reaction to a tweet. If you have to think for more than a moment about whether you like the tweet or not, just skip it.</li>
    <li>Try to find a balance between your <span class="aye icomoon-checkmark-circle"></span> and <span class="nay icomoon-cancel-circle"></span> votes. You might be tempted only to vote <span class="nay icomoon-cancel-circle"></span>, but <span class="aye icomoon-checkmark-circle"></span> votes are equally important for helping wynno to avoid false inferences.</li>
    <li>Don't vote randomly; try to be consistent in the way you vote. This probably goes without saying. Voting randomly only lowers the quality of recommendations wynno can make for you.</li>
  </ol>
</p>

<p>That's it! Enjoy.</p>
