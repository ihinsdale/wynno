**wynno is a tool for seeing the tweets in your Twitter timeline that interest you, and skipping the rest.**

The more people you follow on Twitter, the more you probably find yourself sifting through tweets that don't interest you to find the ones that do. That's the problem that wynno wants to solve.

It's not a problem that can be solved by unfollowing people. Unfollowing someone is too crude a solution if you like some of a person's tweets, and don't want to miss out on those.

wynno enables a finer approach: you can apply specific **filters** to your Twitter timeline. Filters are simply rules you make about the kinds of tweets you want to **hear** or **mute**.

Maybe you always want to hear tweets that contain a particular **hashtag**. Maybe for your job it's important to keep up with breaking news, and so you always want to hear tweets that contain a **keyword** like 'BREAKING'. Or maybe you couldn't care less about breaking news and want to mute those tweets. Maybe you never want to see Foursquare updates or **links** to Facebook from that former coworker of yours, whom you don't really know anyway but nevertheless don't want to unfollow because that would sow seeds of awkwardness. Maybe you always want to hear tweets by that well-read friend of yours whenever she tweets **quotations**. But maybe you've seen enough baby **pictures** from her at this point.

You can make filters for all of these. All tweets caught by a 'hear' filter or which aren't caught by any filter are put in a timeline called Good Stuff. This is the timeline you see first when you load wynno. All tweets caught by a 'mute' filter get moved to another timeline called The Rest. You can look at The Rest as much as you want to, or not look at it at all. That's the simple innovation of wynno: splitting your Twitter timeline in two, according to the rules you make.

There is more complexity to wynno that you can take advantage of if you want to, though. wynno can **suggest filters** for you to adopt. wynno can even create a customized filter just for you which will mute tweets that it thinks you won't like--we call this **automatic wynnoing**.

wynno can do these things once you give it a bit of training, to recognize the tweets you like and dislike. wynno places vote buttons next to tweets that aren't handled by any of your filters. When you vote on tweets, you're telling wynno, "I like tweets like this and want to see this kind of tweet in the future," or the opposite. It's wynno's job to figure out what you mean exactly by 'like this' and 'this kind of tweet'. Because wynno needs a fair amount of data to figure that out, filter suggestions are currently offered after every 100 votes.

Automatic wynnoing requires yet more data to work well; 200 votes are necessary before it can be activated. We'll discuss automatic wynnoing in more depth in another post. For now, we'll just say that the algorithm behind automatic wynnoing is conservative: we recognize that for most users, it's more important not to mute any tweets that you do like than to find and mute all the tweets you don't like.

One last thing, about privacy: your activity on wynno is private. <span class="wynnoPurple">The filters you create, your votes on tweets--none of these are visible to other users.</span> wynno's goal is to improve the experience of consuming your Twitter timeline, by reducing the amount of time spent reading tweets that aren't valuable to you. It helps you turn the cacophony of chirping birds into something more like a symphony. It is not a social network and does not create another public, online presence for you to manage.
